                Online chat may refer to any kind of communication over the Internet that offers a real-time
                transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. Chat messages are generally short in order to
                enable other participants to respond quickly. Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is
                created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as Internet
                forums and email. Online chat may address point-to-point communications as well as multicast
                communications from one sender to many receivers and voice and video chat, or may be a feature of a web
                conferencing service.

                Chat (text only): Multiple participants can be logged into the conference and can interactively share
                resources and ideas. There is also option to save the chat and archive it for later review.
                Voice (telephone or voice-over IP): This is a conference call between the instructor and the
                participating students where they can speak through built-in microphone or a headset.
                Video conferencing: This may or may not require the participants to have their webcams running. Usually,
                a video conference involves a live feed from a classroom or elsewhere or a content.
                Web conferencing: This includes Webinar (Web-based seminar) as well. Unlike in video conferencing,
                participants of a web conferencing can access a wider variety of media elements. Web conferences are
                comparatively more interactive and usually incorporate chat sessions as well.
                Internet radio/podcasts: The instructors makes the audio file available in the Internet which is
                archived and the students subscribed to the podcast can download it.
                Virtual worlds: In this set up, students can meet in virtual world and speak with each other through
                headsets and VoIP. This can make the learning more productive and engaging when the students are able to
                navigate the worlds and operate in their avatar

                Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the
                computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and
                actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all
                information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Computer software includes computer
                programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media.
                Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
